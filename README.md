This is a simple MC Mod that adds Rubies into the game!

This is a resource material that can be found and mined just like other ores.

Ruby is not only a very strong material, but it has hidden benefits.

-------------------------------
In this .jar holds:

Ruby Armor Set,
Ruby Tool Set,
Ruby Ore Block,
Ruby Block,
Ruby Recipes,
Ruby
--------------------------------
For installation, just like all other MC mods:

[If you have not setup Forge version 1.20 or newer, do that or this will not work. Minecraft will not understand what to do with the mod.]

First hit Win key, type %appdata%, and find your .minecraft folder. (This may be hidden, be aware.)

Then, find your "mods" folder. (This may not be made yet, so feel free to make it.)

Drag and drop the .jar into the mods folder.

CTRL+S

Close out.

Launch MC using the Forge version appropriate.

Go to MODS when it loads, and find Ruby. If it is not there, restart the process. 

Most common mistakes are not installing Forge correctly, or placing the mods folder in the wrong place.
"mods" should be in the root directory of your .minecraft folder.

That should be all.
